# Let's consider image (spatial) data.

notes:
image data is an excellent example of data where the orientation of each element is important -- i.e. how we display things in space is not a choice that is really up to us, its up to the data!

# Raster vs. Vector representations of image data

notes:
generally, we'll be in charge of *making* images from data and not using images as data themselves, but it is worth spending some time thinking about how images are actually represented on a computer.

---

## Let's draw a circle.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/single_circle.svg" data-background-size="auto 65%" data-background-position="right 10% bottom 50%"-->

```
center = (x0, y0)
radius = 1.0
```
<!-- .element: class="left_abs" style="width: 50%"-->

notes: we can do the same exercise with a circle

---

## Let's draw many circles.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dots.svg" data-background-size="auto 65%" data-background-position="right 10% bottom 50%"-->

---

## Let's draw many circles.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dots_grid.svg" data-background-size="auto 65%" data-background-position="right 10% bottom 50%"-->

---

## Let's draw many circles.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dots_grid_fill.svg" data-background-size="auto 65%" data-background-position="right 10% bottom 50%"-->

notes: you can see on this raster representation, the representation of each circle gets better as we increase the representation

---

## Let's draw many circles.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dots_grid_fine2.svg" data-background-size="auto 65%" data-background-position="right 10% bottom 50%"-->

## Raster Representation

| | | | | |
|-:|-|-|-|-|
| | 1 Circle | 2 Circles | 30 Circles | 1000 Circles |
|`600x600` | 45kb | 45kb | 45kb | 45kb |
|`1200x1200` | 180kb | 180kb | 180kb | 180kb |
|`2400x2400` | 720kb | 720kb | 720kb | 720kb |

(uncompressed, 1-bit images)

notes: we can also compare the raster and vector representations and see that again, vectors
work better for a small number of objects, and rasters work better for a larger number of objects

---

## Vector Representation

| | | | | |
|-:|-|-|-|-|
| | 1 Circle | 2 Circles | 1000 Circles | 1e6 Circles |
|`600x600` | 3 bytes | 6 bytes | 3000 bytes | 3 Mb |
|`1200x1200` | 3 bytes | 6 bytes | 3000 bytes | 3 Mb |
|`2400x2400` | 3 bytes | 6 bytes | 3000 bytes | 3 Mb |

(uncompressed, single precision)

notes: note here that a circle is represented by less points than the line so the file size is 3Mb compared to 5Mb

---

## Raster or Vector?

<img src="images/menger1.png" width=700>

Vector points: 8 points $\rightarrow$ number of "verticies" to make a cube

Stored as voxels (volumetric pixels): 2.96 kb $\rightarrow$ if we break the cube up into little cubes

notes:
Would it be easier to store this cube as a vector or as raster?
This is larger than a few bytes because it's storing other useful values in CG software.

---

## Raster or Vector?

<img src="images/menger2.png" width=700>

Vector points: 160 points

Stored as voxels (volumetric pixels): 12.28 kb

notes:
Does this change it?
This is a recursive shape known as a Menger Sponge. Each cube keeps getting replaced with the whole previous shape.

---

## Raster or Vector?

<img src="images/menger3.png" width=700>

Vector points: 3200 points

Stored as voxels (volumetric pixels): 445.05 kb

notes:


---

## Raster or Vector?

<img src="images/menger4.png" width=700>

Vector points: 64000 points

Stored as voxels (volumetric pixels): 9.59Mb

notes:
Does it make a difference yet?

---

## Raster or Vector?

<img src="images/menger5.png" width=700>

Vector points: 1.28M points

Stored as voxels (volumetric pixels): 190.93 Mb

notes:


---

## Raster or Vector?

<img src="images/menger6.png" width=700>

Vector points: 25.6M points

Stored as voxels: 3.73 Gb

notes:


---

## Raster or Vector?

<img src="images/menger6.png" width=700>

Vector points: 25.6M points

Stored as voxels: 3.73 Gb

Size of this image: 1280 x 720 = 921600

notes:
There are 25 times more points than pixels, and most of the pixels don't include the shape - we aren't
seeing the details of this image anymore


---

## Infinite resolution

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/nature.jpg)

notes:
nature has nearly infinite resolution, down to the atom.
It's much easier to discretize this scene to the level of pixels than to try to use vector shapes to describe everything happening in the photo.

## Geographical Data

Which of these are better represented as raster or vector?
 1. State Boundaries
 2. Relief (height) Map
 3. Population Density
 4. Capitol Cities

notes:
a simple cheat is anytime you see the word "density", it's easier to represent with raster.

# An aside on binary representations.

## Binary

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/binaryMath1.jpg)

notes:
Who can tell me what decimal number these binary digits represent?

---

## Binary

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/binaryMath2.jpg)

notes:
2 to each exponent is flipped on or off, then the on-values are added together.

---

## Binary

notes:
Who can tell me what these digits represent in decimal?

---

## Binary

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/binaryMath.jpg)

notes:
Computers use electrical current to turn millions of switches called "bits" on or off. They combine 8 bits together like this to make a "byte". 

---

```

390,1.83970e-003,-4.53930e-004,1.21520e-002
```

If we assume ASCII encoding, this becomes:

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|"390" <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> |51 |57 |48 |
<!-- .element: style="margin-left: 0.2em;" -->

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/ASCII-Table2.jpeg)

notes:
A string is not a number, but a list of characters. A character is a symbol represented by a unique byte as described in the ASCII table.

---

```

390,1.83970e-003,-4.53930e-004,1.21520e-002
```

If we assume ASCII encoding, this becomes:

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|"390" <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> |51 |57 |48 |
<!-- .element: style="margin-left: 0.2em;" -->

Breaking this further down, we encode each character:

||||||||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|51 <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
|57 <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
|48 <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
<!-- .element: style="margin-left: 0.2em;" -->

---

```

390,1.83970e-003,-4.53930e-004,1.21520e-002
```

Then a string-to-float function translates the string "390" into a floating point number.

For a 32-bit, single-precision floating point number in the computer this looks like:

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/floatSample1_2.jpg)

notes:
This is how our example would be stored as an IEEE754 Single precision 32-bit float. This IEEE standard for encoding floats tries to optimize for very small and very large numbers, with the understanding that computers cannot store infinite accuracy.

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/floatSample1_finalm3.jpeg)

---

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/floatSample1_finalm4.jpeg)

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/floatSample1_finalm5.jpeg)

---

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/floatSample1_finalm6.jpeg)

---
```

390,1.83970e-003,-4.53930e-004,1.21520e-002
```

|||||||||||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| "1.83970e-03" <!-- .element: class="table-hl" -->| 49 | 46 | 56 | 51 | 57 | 55 | 48 | 101 | 45 | 48 | 51 |
<!-- .element: style="margin-left: 0.2em;"-->

And this is translated into a floating pointer number as well:

notes:
Point being, reading a CSV file is pretty processor intensive - so it's not a great format for huge datasets.
