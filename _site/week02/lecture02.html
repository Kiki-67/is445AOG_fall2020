---

## Weekly Visualization Reports

Every week, you are to turn in a visualization you have found in the media
(newspapers, magazines, online journalism) and a brief summary of something you like/don't like,
think is interesting, etc.

_These are meant to be easy points:_ No more than 2-3 sentences are needed in your description.

Each week, one of you will at random be asked to describe the visualization you picked to the class.

notes:
our first one is assigned today, due next week -- remember, I'll pick someone randomly to ask you about yours!

---

## Assignment 1

<span style="color:red">Part 2: an intake survey</span> -  https://forms.gle/daHMr8n8Vd97rUCv8

<span style="color:red">Part 3: Say hi on Slack!</a>

notes:
these last two count for ~20% of this hw grade so I'll carefully ignore you if you are typing on something else for a few min!

---

## Another reading reference added

See syllabus: https://uiuc-ischool-dataviz.github.io/spring2020/syllabus.html

notes:

this does not cover interactive stuff, but its still a nice reference and its free!

---

## Homework grading

 * Homework points will be listed as reference, all HWs will be graded out of 100%, all HWs are worth the same
 * We do not drop a HW score

---

## Choose your own adventure

There are 3 pathways (that I can see in this course, could be more!)

 1. "I am here to get better at programming and play with viz platforms"
 1. "I am thinking about a career in data viz."
 1. "I don't know/I am new to programming and I want to focus on that."

notes:
just a few reminders if you're in the 3rd track, or any track really!

---

## Choose your own adventure

There are 3 pathways (that I can see in this course, could be more!)

 3. "I don't know/I am new to programming and I want to focus on that."
    * Strategy: 
       * look at the code, focus heavily on Python
       * <span style="color:red">read the prep notebooks before class!</span>
       * do the Javascript parts
       * if you're new to programming, do Javascript parts in class, and build on them for any HW
       * come back to the optional texts/docs after the course is over

---

## Many ways to get notes

 1. The course website, last I taught it - https://uiuc-ischool-dataviz.github.io/spring2019online/
 1. The course website, Fall 2019 - https://uiuc-ischool-dataviz.github.io/fall2019/
 1. I'll also be posting the equivalent Spring 2019 (online) notebooks to each week of this course

## Today

<img src="images/data_viz_diagram.png">

notes:

today we're going to get some practice with the practicalities of dealing with data

We'll talk a bit about the kinds of data that are out there and their definitions, and how many people disagree on these definitions!

---

<img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6efa5f_e6f70adbf18e41fd8e369abc4c309563~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_770,h_434,al_c,lg_1,q_85/Types%20of%20Data_Visual_PNG.webp">

notes:
So, usually you're probably used to thinking about data like this - numerical or quantitative which is then broken down into discrete & continous.

Also categorical or qualitative data which is either ordered (ordinal) or unordered (nominal).

---

<img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6efa5f_e6f70adbf18e41fd8e369abc4c309563~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_770,h_434,al_c,lg_1,q_85/Types%20of%20Data_Visual_PNG.webp">

We need to dig a little deeper for data viz.

notes:
This is a fine for something like stats, but we have to start thinking about how data type and format maps itself visually -- what is the best mapping for our visual cortex?

---

## Data organization is important

<img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQED2s2Lgpvgqw/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0?e=1583971200&v=beta&t=MasiisDI3MPVYATH3fcJAWFyIwyypUIb3V2pzA4viWg">

notes:
We have to think a little bit about how our data represents reality *and* how it is represented on disk.

for example, both spatial data like that on a map and data that we use to compare salaries for example, are numerical data - we have lat/long and data value combinations for geographic data and numbers for salaries, but there is something fundementally different about how we would represent these two datasets on a visualization

Similarly for categorical data like with an organization, network, or a tree -- this data is much different than a table of categorical occurances.

---

## Example: Temporal data is numerical, but its also something "else"

<!-- .slide: class="two-floating-elements" -->

<div class="left">

<img src="https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/aesthetic_mapping_files/figure-html/temp-normals-vs-time-1.png" width="400px">

</div>

<div class="right">

<img src="https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/coordinate_systems_axes_files/figure-html/temperature-normals-polar-1.png" width="400px">

</div>

notes:
temporal data, like here the temperature change in a vew places over time, is numerical, but, depending on what time spans we are interested in, its can also be periodic

The first graph tell us a lot, and the 2nd may at first be a little weird to read but it tells us information about both changes in time and the averages about the place *and* it captures a central nature about this data - that it is periodic

## Files, Data, and Organization

* Text
  * ASCII (raw)
  * CSV / TSV
  * JSON
* Binary
  * HDF5
  * PNG/BMP/GIF/JPG/etc
  * Excel
  * Arrow
* Query-based
  * SQL
  * JSON/REST

<div class="right" markdown=1>

<img src="images/hdf5pic.png" alt="drawing" width="250"/>

<img src="images/jsonex.png" alt="drawing" width="150"/>

</div>

notes:
We also need to worry a bit about how this data is stored on disk because that will tell us what steps are between us and (1) making the data user-friendly *and* putting into a format that we can make a visualization with

read-write operations from disk are extremely time consuming, so raw text files come with massive overhead

REST = REpresentational State Transfer - web architecture that keeps clients and servers independent and queries using flexible JSON formatting.

---

## The "simple" pipeline

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/viz_diagram.svg.png" data-background-size="contain"-->

notes: what we want is something like this where we have some data, we load it into Python/javascript/whatever and then we make a super cool viz.

---

## The "simple" pipeline... is not so simple

From Elizabeth Wickes' talk: https://zenodo.org/record/3563145#.XjdvdRNKgtc

<img src="images/elliexWickesTalk.png">

notes:
We know that this is not easy though! Especially for "complicated" data like we might run into out in the wild. While most of the data we'll use here will be less messy than "out in the wild" data, we nevertheless need to figure out how to process it a bit.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/viz_diagram2.svg.png" data-background-size="contain"-->

notes:
Today we are going to practice a bit of the data-reading part ourselves, but usually we are going to be
able to make use of readers.

And we'll see how to go from raw "read in" data to data that is viz-ready.

# Let's consider tabular data

---

## Organization

| | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Row 1|11|21|31|41|
|Row 2|12|22|32|42|
|Row 3|13|23|33|43|

Internally, this data is stored linearly, with one value immediately following
another.  We can do this in two methods:

||||||||||||||
|:-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Row | 11 | 21 | 31 | 41 | 12 | 22 | 32 | 42 | 13 | 23 | 33 | 43 |
| Column | 11 | 12 | 13 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 31 | 32 | 33 | 41 | 42 | 43 |

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Organization: Row

| | | | | | | | | | | |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| 11 <!--.element: class="table-hl" -->| <!--.element: class="table-hl" -->21 | 31 | 41 | 12 | 22 | 32 | 42 | 13 | 23 | 33 | 43 |

In row-oriented storage, successive _fields_ for a single _record_ are
adjacent.

<div style="height: 2.0em;"></div>

### Organization: Column

| | | | | | | | | | | |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| 11 <!--.element: class="table-hl" -->| 12 | 13 | <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> 21 | 22 | 23 | 31 | 32 | 33 | 41 | 42 | 43 |

In column-oriented storage, successive _records_ for a single _field_ are
adjacent.

notes:
These formats are more efficient when the information you're interested in is adjacent. For instance, operations requiring many rows and only a few columns benefit from row-oriented storage.

---

## CSV (Comma-separated values)

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5 |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| . | . | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | . |
| . | . | . | . | . |

<div style="height: 2.0em;"></div>

---

## CSV (Comma-separated values)

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/automobilesCSV.png)

 * "Lowest-common denominator format" (widest available)
 * Flexible delimiters 
 * Ad hoc comments and headers (data readers need to be adapted)
 * Row-oriented
 * Row-size can vary: no implicit indexing

notes:
Sometimes called "DSV" or "Delimiter-separated values"

Ad hoc means data readers need to be adapted to format.

```

notes:
Let's take this sample data and see how it's represented in computer memory.

---

```

390,1.83970e-003,-4.53930e-004,1.21520e-002
```

If we assume ASCII encoding, this becomes:

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|"390" <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> |51 |57 |48 |
<!-- .element: style="margin-left: 0.2em;" -->

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/ASCII-Table2.jpeg)

notes:
A string is not a number, but a list of characters. A character is a symbol represented by a unique byte as described in the ASCII table.

---

```

390,1.83970e-003,-4.53930e-004,1.21520e-002
```

If we assume ASCII encoding, this becomes:

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|"390" <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> |51 |57 |48 |
<!-- .element: style="margin-left: 0.2em;" -->

Breaking this further down, we encode each character:

||||||||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|51 <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
|57 <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
|48 <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
<!-- .element: style="margin-left: 0.2em;" -->

---

```

**See aside on binary representations at the end of the lecture notes if you are curious!**

---

## JSON

| | | |
|:-|:-|:-|
| Record 1 | Record 2 | Record 3 |

<div style="height: 2.0em;"></div>

 * Row-oriented
 * Potentially-unknown subcomponent sizes (lists of lists)
 * Common response to REST APIs
 * Multiple types
   * String
   * Number
   * Object (JSON)
   * Array (list)
   * Boolean
   * null
 * Format of .ipynb Python Notebooks

notes:
Another way to store tabular-like data is with JSON files.

XML-like syntax for storing data values. 

All fields for a record are presented at once.

REST = REpresentational State Transfer - web architecture that keeps clients and servers independent and queries using flexible JSON formatting.

**take a look at a jupyter notebook!**

<div style="height: 2.0em;"></div>

 * `[` and `]` indicate an array

## HDF5

| | | |

# Let's revisit image (spatial) data.

notes:
image data is an excellent example of data where the orientation of each element is important -- i.e. how we display things in space is not a choice that is really up to us, its up to the data!

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../week01/images/stitch_nobg_tilted.png" data-background-size="contain"-->

how is this dataset "fundementally" different than a tabular dataset?

Or columns?

Is information lost or confused?

```
start = (x0, y0)
end   = (x1, y1)
width = 1.0
```
<!-- .element: class="left_abs" style="width: 50%"-->

notes:
you can see a line is basically 5 bytes in memory - one byte for each integer end point coordinate, and one byte for the width.

---

Convert to an 8x8 image.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/line_grid.svg" data-background-size="auto 65%" data-background-position="right 10% bottom 50%"-->

notes: so, if we map this line to an image, we see that we lose a bit of information - the graphic becomes pixelated

notes: so we see our pixelation gets less and less sever if we increase the number of pixels in our image

---

## Representations

We will concern ourselves with understanding two representations of an image:
the **raster** representation and the **vector** representation.

---

## Representations: raster

 * Each pixel is represented as a color (encoded by something like RGB)

notes: there are other encodings like HSV

---

## Representations: raster

 * Each pixel is represented as a color (encoded by something like RGB)
 * Common file formats such as GIF, JPG, PNG

---

## Representations: raster

 * Each pixel is represented as a color (encoded by something like RGB)
 * Common file formats such as GIF, JPG, PNG
 * Compression can be lossy (JPG) or lossless (PNG)
 * Common Editors: Paint, Photoshop

---

 * Common Editors: Paint, Photoshop

In a raster image, you describe precisely what to display at each pixel.

---

## Representations: vector

 * Each component is defined as a "drawing" component, or some action to be
   taken by the rendering engine.  This can include paths, patterns,
   shapes, and text.  Components have properties associated with them.

 * The display does not exist until it is "rendered."
 * Options for compression include (lossless) text compression, although
   the rendering engine can simplify display

## Representations: vector

 * Each component is defined as a "drawing" component, or some action to be
   taken by the rendering engine.  This can include paths, patterns,
   shapes, and text.  Components have properties associated with them.
 * Common file formats are SVG, PDF, EPS
 * The display does not exist until it is "rendered."
 * Options for compression include (lossless) text compression, although
   the rendering engine can simplify display
 * Common Editors: Illustrator, Inkscape

If a line covers fewer than 40 pixels, raster is less memory than vector

notes:
keep in mind, compression algorithms can make these comparisons a little fuzzier

## Representations

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/bigPixels.jpg)

notes:
in this image, all the lines ARE less than 40 pixels

---

## Representations

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/smallPixels.jpg)

notes:
but in this image, the lines aren't. What's the difference? 

The difference is the ratio of the size of the lines to the raster resolution.

## Representations

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/zoomedPixels.jpg)

notes:
and now we're back to less than 40 pixels per line. But what changed? Not the resolution.

Now most of the line goes off the screen. We haven't changed the coordinates, we've just zoomed in.

Raster data discards any information outside of the domain. Vector data preserves all information, regardless of boundaries.

## Raster Representation

| | | | | |
|-:|-|-|-|-|
| | 1 Line | 10 Lines | 1000 Lines | 1e6 Lines |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `600x600` | 45kb &nbsp; | 45kb | 45kb | 45kb |

notes: lets look at a few examples - for a 600x600 pixel image, we have to define data
at each pixel, reguardless if we have a line there or not...

---

## Raster Representation

| | | | | |
|-:|-|-|-|-|

|`1200x1200` | 180kb | 180kb | 180kb | 180kb |

notes: so, if we increase the number of lines in the image...

## Raster Representation

| | | | | |
|-:|-|-|-|-|

|`2400x2400` | 720kb | 720kb | 720kb | 720kb |

(uncompressed, 1-bit images)

600 x 600 = 360,000 bits / 8 = 45,000 bytes = 45 kilobytes

notes:
You can see that regardless of the number of shapes, the image size stays the same

---

## Vector Representation

| | | | | |
|-:|-|-|-|-|
| | 1 Line | 10 Lines | 1000 Lines | 1e6 Lines |
|`600x600` | 5 bytes | 50 bytes | 5kb | 5Mb |
|`1200x1200` | 5 bytes | 50 bytes | 5kb | 5Mb |
|`2400x2400` | 5 bytes | 50 bytes | 5kb | 5Mb |

(uncompressed, single precision)

notes:
see that now the memory required increases with increasing number of lines

Now no matter the image size, the shape data stays the same size. You can see that with a large number of shapes, the raster representation becomes smaller for a large number of lines - 5Mb vs 720kb for the largest number of lines

## Let's draw a circle.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/single_circle.svg" data-background-size="auto 65%" data-background-position="right 10% bottom 50%"-->

```
center = (x0, y0)
radius = 1.0
```
<!-- .element: class="left_abs" style="width: 50%"-->

notes: we can do the same exercise with a circle

(uncompressed, 1-bit images)

notes: we can also compare the raster and vector representations and see that again, vectors
work better for a small number of objects, and rasters work better for a larger number of objects

---

## Vector Representation

| | | | | |
|-:|-|-|-|-|

|`2400x2400` | 3 bytes | 6 bytes | 3000 bytes | 3 Mb |

(uncompressed, single precision)

notes: note here that a circle is represented by less points than the line so the file size is 3Mb compared to 5Mb

## Raster or Vector?

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/menger1.png)

Vector points: 8 points $\rightarrow$ number of "verticies" to make a cube

Stored as voxels (volumetric pixels): 2.96 kb $\rightarrow$ if we break the cube up into little cubes

notes:
Would it be easier to store this cube as a vector or as raster?
This is larger than a few bytes because it's storing other useful values in CG software.

---

## Raster or Vector?

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/menger2.png)

Vector points: 160 points

notes:
Does this change it?
This is a recursive shape known as a Menger Sponge. Each cube keeps getting replaced with the whole previous shape.

There are 25 times more points than pixels, and most of the pixels don't include the shape - we aren't
seeing the details of this image anymore

## Infinite resolution

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/nature.jpg)

notes:
nature has nearly infinite resolution, down to the atom.
It's much easier to discretize this scene to the level of pixels than to try to use vector shapes to describe everything happening in the photo.

## Text

Modern fonts are composed of glyphs defined by functional forms of their shape.
Font rendering engines such as freetype2 can generate bitmaps for fonts
rendered at specific resolutions.

## Geographical Data

Which of these are better represented as raster or vector?
 1. State Boundaries
 2. Relief (height) Map
 3. Population Density
 4. Capitol Cities

notes:
a simple cheat is anytime you see the word "density", it's easier to represent with raster.

# Doing Stuff with Data

Now that we understand a few ways that data can be stored, let's do some things
to it.

---

<div class="left">

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/palette.jpg)

<!-- .element: style="height: 20em;" -->
</div>

<div class="right" style="font-size: 150%;">
<div style="height: 4.0em;"></div>
You have a palette of operations to apply.
</div>

---

## Filtering Operations

 * Relationships:
   * Equality, inequality
   * Quantitative value (less than, greater than)
   * Intersection, disjoint
 * Subsampling
   * Regular sampling
   * Randomized sampling
   * Nyquist frequency
 * Related data queries
   * Queries on other columns at fixed row location
   * External membership queries

---

## Relationships Examples

 * Equality
   * Identity
   * Quantitative values
 * Ordering or quantitative
   * Less than (or equal)
   * Greater than (or equal)
   * "Comes before" and "Comes after"
 * Set-based operations
   * "Is a member"
   * "Is not a member"
   * "Shares members"
   * "Shares no members"

---

## Examples

### Equality

```
value == "hello"
value == 10
```

### Ordering and Quantitative

```
value < 30
value > July 1, 2010
```

### Set-Based

```
value in ("red", "blue")
value not in (3.141, 2.7)
```

---

## Sampling

We can choose a subset of points and use those to explore our data.  This is
not without its possible faults, however.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/sampling_fig1.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/sampling_fig2.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/sampling_fig3.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

notes:
We might preserve the shape better by alternate sampling methods. These random samplings preserve features that the uniform samplings lost - but they also lose features that the uniform sampling preserved.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/sampling_fig4.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

notes:
You'll also notice that high rates of change are more susceptible to data loss. A better sampling algorithm would target these fast changing regions.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/sampling_fig5.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

notes:
the Nyquist limit is the minimum rate at which a signal can be sampled without introducing errors - 2x the highest frequency in the data.

You can see that in this higher frequency data, the same sampling rates fall apart faster.

# An aside on binary representations.

## Binary

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/binaryMath1.jpg)

notes:
Who can tell me what decimal number these binary digits represent?

---

## Binary

---

## Binary

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/binaryMath.jpg)

notes:
Computers use electrical current to turn millions of switches called "bits" on or off. They combine 8 bits together like this to make a "byte". 

---

```

390,1.83970e-003,-4.53930e-004,1.21520e-002
```

If we assume ASCII encoding, this becomes:

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|"390" <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> |51 |57 |48 |
<!-- .element: style="margin-left: 0.2em;" -->

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/ASCII-Table2.jpeg)

notes:
A string is not a number, but a list of characters. A character is a symbol represented by a unique byte as described in the ASCII table.

---

```

390,1.83970e-003,-4.53930e-004,1.21520e-002
```

If we assume ASCII encoding, this becomes:

| | | |
|-|-|-|
|"390" <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> |51 |57 |48 |
<!-- .element: style="margin-left: 0.2em;" -->

Breaking this further down, we encode each character:

||||||||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|51 <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
|57 <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
|48 <!-- .element: class="table-hl" --> | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
<!-- .element: style="margin-left: 0.2em;" -->

---

```

390,1.83970e-003,-4.53930e-004,1.21520e-002
```

Then a string-to-float function translates the string "390" into a floating point number.

For a 32-bit, single-precision floating point number in the computer this looks like:

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/floatSample1_2.jpg)

notes:
This is how our example would be stored as an IEEE754 Single precision 32-bit float. This IEEE standard for encoding floats tries to optimize for very small and very large numbers, with the understanding that computers cannot store infinite accuracy.

---

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/floatSample1_finalm6.jpeg)

---
```

390,1.83970e-003,-4.53930e-004,1.21520e-002
```

|||||||||||||
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| "1.83970e-03" <!-- .element: class="table-hl" -->| 49 | 46 | 56 | 51 | 57 | 55 | 48 | 101 | 45 | 48 | 51 |
<!-- .element: style="margin-left: 0.2em;"-->

And this is translated into a floating pointer number as well:

![](/is445AOG_fall2020/week02/images/floatSample2.jpg)

notes:
Point being, reading a CSV file is pretty processor intensive - so it's not a great format for huge datasets.
