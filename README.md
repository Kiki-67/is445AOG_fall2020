# Course Template

This repository is a template for managing coursework using GitHub pages.  It
uses the theme [dinky](https://github.com/pages-themes/dinky),
[nbviewer.js](https://github.com/kokes/nbviewer.js), and
[reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) for presenting material.

For each week of class, create a subdirectory `weekZZ` (where `ZZ` is the week
of the class) and place any `.ipynb` and `.md` files in that directory.
Lectures can utilize the layout `lecture`, which will present them in revealjs.

## Instructions to get started:

For basic class info, modify: _data/class.yml, _includes/class_info.html and _config.yml

For your github repo -  make sure to turn on github pages and make sure it shows the correct github.io location.  
Do this under __Settings__ for this repo. For example, this one is USERNAME.github.io/CLASSNUMBER:
![](assets/ghpages.png)


## For each lesson:

For each day or week (a single lesson) of class, create a subdirectory `lessonZZ` (where `ZZ` is the day
of the class) and place any `.ipynb` and `.md` files in that directory.
Lectures can utilize the layout `lecture`, which will present them in revealjs.

## Notes on Course Materials

As of Fall 2020, this section and the [section developed in parallel by Matthew Turk](https://github.com/UIUC-iSchool-DataViz/fall2020-bo) have
diverged somewhat.  Occasionally, contributions will be passed back and forth
and the commit message history may not reflect the original authorship.
These two repositories have been developed in collaboration, and authorship is
